# SquareEyes

Welcome to **SquareEyes**, a dynamic web application designed to showcase movies using JavaScript and a school API. This project integrates robust front-end technologies to provide an interactive and engaging user experience, allowing users to browse movies, filter them by genre, and manage a shopping cart.

## Features

- **Dynamic Movie Display**: Movies are dynamically loaded onto the main page using JavaScript which fetches data from a school API.
- **Genre Filtering**: Users can filter movies based on genre to find their preferred type of content quickly.
- **Interactive Shopping Cart**: Users can add movies to their cart, view the cart with a total cost calculation, and remove movies if desired.
- **Checkout Process**: A simulated checkout process where users can enter their details (name, address, and email) and review their cart before final confirmation.
- **Confirmation Screen**: After checking out, users receive a confirmation screen, enhancing the shopping experience.
